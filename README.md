# rada

This package provides a simple `Date` type for working with dates without times or zones.

## Origins

This is a port of the [justinmimbs/date](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/date/latest) Elm library.
Done with the kind permission of the author. The API has been adjusted to match norms of the Gleam language in places.

gleam add rada
```
